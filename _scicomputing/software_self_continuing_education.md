## Background

If you've been programming for any length of time you've probably realized that this is a profession of lifelong learning.
For my first few years in a 'big kid' programming job, I threw myself into the problems given to me headfirst, often 
without knowing much about the language or background of the project at all.  While I made things work and got things done,
I knew there had to be a more structured way to approach these patterns of problems I was seeing over and over again.  I 
hoped to find a mentor of some kind for a while, but found the truth of the matter is that while a lot of people are 
happy to answer questions here and their for you, they have their lives and a lot of a programmer's journey is through
hours of research and practice along (and in collaboration with others). Not to mention the problems you tend to really
get stuck on are ones that take so much domain knowledge that very few mentors not intimately involved in the topic can
really give a lot of insight. So I ventured out into the world, to find new sources of inspiration.

## Who's this for?
Anyone who is learning programming / data science / software engineering, and is looking for a way to continue learning 
more broad topics outside of their day to day work while still maintaining a life. Many of the resources I will suggest 
are fairly light and conceptual and don't require a high degree of input, perfect to play in the background while cooking
a nice candle lit dinner.

## Resources
It's important to know what kind of learning resource you like to consume from the best - audiobook, e-book, textbook. I 
often like textbooks as I find the larger pages are easier to read through code examples with, but they're also big and
take up a lot of space.  Audiobooks can be tough as a lot of more detailed discussions get visual quickly, but podcasts 
are well suited to getting up to speed with high-level overviews of all the hot new technologies that the FAANG and startup
companies are adopting, and can give great reference points for further reading.  Below is a list of various resources I've
found extremely helpful for expanding both my broad knowledge of the technology industry, as well as more detailed concepts
surrounding problems in a tech and computer science:
- Books (in the rough order I'd recommend)
    - Clean Code: Great diatribe on code style and readability which can be a bit dogmatic, but gives really good rule of thumbs 
        for writing much easier to read code (and your coworkers will thank you later). Just don't get too caught up in the pedantics.  
    - Code Complete: Goes through importance of entire development process, including things like strong requirements gathering and testing in design. 
    - Design Patterns (Gang of Four): Outlines general architectural patterns that can be adapted to solve commonly seen problems in application development
    - Designing Data-Intensive Applications: explores distributed technologies and the problems encountered in distributed domains
    - Clean Architecture    
    - Patterns of Enterprise Application Design: Highly detailed patterns for application service layers, more focused on the
                                                data-centric layers near the data source.  Most examples are in Java or C#, 
                                                but they are pretty easy to follow.  Half the book is a reference of patterns,
                                                while the other half is a narrative of why those patterns exist and how they
                                                can be used together.
    - Pattern-oriented Software Design: Highly in depth patterns for different application service layers and their interfaces.
                                        Somewhat meant to be a reference book, although there is a narrative chapter in the beginning
                                        describing the motivation for some of the patterns and how they fit together well.
    - Microservices: High-level overview of the microservices approach to architecture design, helpful for clearing up 
                     some of the nebulus concepts not generally explained by the term 'microservices', but also not 
                     particularly in depth.
    The patterns books (Design Patterns, Patterns of Enterprise Application Design, and Pattern-Oriented Software Design) 
        aren't necessarily meant to be meant cover to cover, but flipping through the patterns in the reference section 
        you'll be surprised how many apply to situations you may deal with very frequently, and can give you a really 
        nice framework for dealing with them.
        
- Podcasts:  
   I really like podcasts for more high-level topics, when I can be doing chores around the house or maybe going for a walk
   or a long drive. I find podcasts which explore new techologies without getting too into the weeds of how they work to be a
   great way to see what new is going on in this amazingly quickly changing world. Some of my favorite podcasts are:
   
  - <strong>[Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/)</strong> - 30-60m episodes; the host has a new guest on each day, usually from an up an coming startup
  or from an established company like FaceBook or Google to talk about topics varying from their data infrastructure, growth
  pains, cultivating healthy work environments, and more.  It loosely follows different genres like digital banking, data engineering,
  frontend frameworks, open source communities, cloud engineering and more.  They also have an app and a smaller amount of 
  printed articles on their website, https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/.  This has been one of my favorite low-input 
  podcasts for learning some basics of new technologies that companies are using, so I can look into them more later.
  
  - <strong>[Data Engineering Daily](https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/)</strong> - Similar to Software Engineering Daily except the main focus is on data engineering,
  so most of the interviews are with Data Ops people from companies with large data infrastructures like Uber and Google, and
  if often gets into a bit more of the nitty gritty of how the plumbing works. Requires a bit more focus, but can be super interesting.
  
  -<strong>[Software Engineering Radio](https://se-daily.net)</strong> - Pretty in depth 1-2 hour interviews with experts in their
  fields across the industry, from DNS Security to Kafta Event Logs tp Zero-Trust Networks and interviews with creators of languages 
  like Rust and Elm.  The interviews can get pretty dense, but you can also learn a lot from them about technologies, and 
  how / when they work.  They interview some really really smart people on there
  
  - <strong>[CodingBlocks](https://www.codingblocks.net/)</strong> - The episode are really long (like 2 hours) and a lot of it is the four guys just chit chatting,
  but they have a number of select episodes where they go through books like Clean Architecture, Clean Code, and Design Patterns
  as a group, which at the time I found very helpful. 
  
  - <strong>[StackOverfowPodcast](https://stackoverflow.blog/podcast/) - Super light, pretty comedic.  It goes more over pop
  culture events occurring the tech world, like .node and github acquisition controversies. The hosts are hilarious, and while 
  you might not get as much educational value out of it it's a fun one to list to while still staying plugged into the tech world. 
  They also do tend to have a few pretty interesting tech news stories per episode as well. 
  
  - <strong>[Lambda Cast](https://soundcloud.com/lambda-cast) - I found this podcast pretty mindblowing coming from a 
  classic Object-Oriented background, and it really had some profound influences on how I program today. If you're not very
  familiar with functional programming, the first 2-3 episodes do a great job of walking one through the initial concepts
  and why those ideals are so sought after in the functional paradigm.  I highly recommend at least the first few episodes 
  if you don't have a very good understanding of functional programming and want to know more.

## Projects
The number one way to really further your abilities as a programmer is to do exactly that; program.  It can be really hard to
find a project that you feel good enough to contribute to, or that is exactly suited to your interests, but part of learning
to program is learning to tackle challenges you don't know how to solve and may not initially be too interested in solving. 
By writing practice projects you prove your understanding by weaving together various concepts learned through different routes.
Some example projects could be: 
- a personal website / blog to write about things you've personally learned or your other hobbies (something I'm currently trying
to do to build up my front-end skills).  
- a data science project performing statistical analysis or machine modeling of datasets pulled of Kaggle or one of the many other 
open dataset sources. Lots of state and municipal governments publish tons of open data, and collecting, merging and analysing various 
datasets to answer questions like 'when it is really likeliest to be busiest on the U-Bridge?' would be pretty cool, and would 
expose one to everything from data collection, cleaning, merging, and analysis.
- Writing a small game to explore graphics modules or languages like JavaScript.  

There also is actually a subreddit community called [ProgrammingPals](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingPals/) where people look for others who might want to collaborate 
on a project, mostly just for practice. It seems to have been pretty active recently, check it out! 

## Community Interest Groups
There is a really wonderful Python community group in Seattle called PuPPy, whose slack channel you can join [here](https://www.meetup.com/PSPPython/messages/78246070/).  They have
some true magicians over there, and the events I've been to have been very social and friendly, very easy to meet people of all different skill sets.  

There is also a highly active [Seattle useR Group](https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-useR/) for R programmers to meet and discuss new ides, with 
many Hutch members already attending meetings regularly. 

There is also a great Postgres community group called [SEAPUG](https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Postgres/events/sphzxlyzhbkb/) 
actually held at the Hutch with a number of our own employees leading the talks.
