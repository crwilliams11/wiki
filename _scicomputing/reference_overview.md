The rest of this wiki provides general guidelines and approaches to working with data at Fred Hutch. This reference section includes information on where to obtain training, how to get started coding, and how to access boilerplate language for grants.

Other relevant sections from other parts of the wiki include the [Resource library](/compdemos/) (tutorials and demonstrations), [Code Examples and Templates](/scicomputing/software_examples/) (larger-scale coding projects), and [Announcements](/scicompannounce/) from Scientific Computing.

## [Training and Finding Help](/scicomputing/reference_training/)

There are many opportunities for training (courses and tutorials) and connecting with coding communities. The Fred Hutch Bioinformatics and Data Science Cooperative (The Coop) and fredhutch.io offer events and meeting groups. Additional opportunities are available elsewhere in Seattle (at UW and through Meetup.com) and online.

## [Information for Grant Writers](/scicomputing/compute_grants/)

This section includes boilerplate language about resources for research computing that is appropriate for inclusion in grant proposals.
