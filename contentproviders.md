Would you like to contribute to the Biomedical Data Science Wiki? Do you have content to add and/or a page to create? See below for guidelines on how to effectively add your content. If you are new to [github](https://github.com/) or [wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki), do not worry: you'll get up-to-speed and comfortable in no time.

## Guidelines for Wiki Content Providers
This curated Wiki relies upon the Fred Hutch research community itself to improve, expand and evolve over time. Because the Wiki's content spans many research areas, we need and welcome contributions from a similarly wide range of researchers and Fred Hutch staff. To help facilitate this we have a process in place to help add your content. See the bullets below for more info.

- [What type and how do I add content?](https://github.com/FredHutch/wiki#content-contribution-and-review-process)
- [What is the content review process?](https://github.com/FredHutch/wiki#the-review-process)
- [It may be helpful to check out the Wiki Content Style Guide](https://github.com/FredHutch/wiki#wiki-content-style-guide)

These bulleted points cover the process of how to add content to the Biomedical Data Science Wiki but there are multiple tools/approaches to make edits and add content.
